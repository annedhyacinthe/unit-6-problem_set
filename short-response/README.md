## Short Response Questions:

1. Why is asynchronous code such a fundamental part of programming in JavaScript?
Its fundamental because it allows for programs to be fluid, meaning that the program would not be blocked or stopped because of the waiting of a response it would instead continue on in the code. 

2. What is a Promise? When were Promises made available in JavaScript? What did they replace and why do they represent an improvement on the previous way asynchronous functions were handled?
A promise is the eventual completion or rejection of an asynchronous function. Promises were made available acouple of years ago and they were replacing the nested callbacks therefore making it easier to handle errors.

3. What are `async` functions? What is their relationship to Promises? What improvements does `async`/`await` introduce?
`Async` functions are functions that allow the program to continue to read code even without a completed or rejected response from that function. An `async` function returns a promise.  `Async`and`await` allows not only for easier code readability but it also lessons the chances of confusion for the coder.
4. Consider one of your favorite apps. Describe one feature of that app that is likely powered by AJAX.
One aspect of Youtube that is likely powered by AJAX is the ability to perform different actions while a video is loading. For example I can add another video to my queue or minimize the the video screen and start another search.
